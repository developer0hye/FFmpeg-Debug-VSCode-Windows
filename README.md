# FFmpeg-Debug-VSCode-Windows

This guide is a modern version of [neptune46/ffmpeg-vscode](https://github.com/neptune46/ffmpeg-vscode) written four years ago.

## Preparation

### 1. Download MSYS2

Just follow [the official installation guide](https://www.msys2.org/#installation).

I recommend you run `pacman -Syu` command several times at `step 5` because downloading some packages can be failed due to some issues.

If the installation is finished sucessfully, you can see the results like the below.

```bash
Yonghye@DESKTOP-RNUFNCT MSYS ~
# pacman -Syu
:: Synchronizing package databases...
 mingw32 is up to date
 mingw64 is up to date
